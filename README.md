## How to Play
1. Download this repo. 
2. Launch the [index.html](./index.html) with your default browser.
3. Get to the river!!!  
<br>
## Instructions
You start as the hero and can use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to maneuver from square to square.  Once you get to the road, you are vulnerable to oncoming enemies, or bugs!  Dodge them to make it safely to the river and win!

## Dependencies
A lot of the code in this project was supplied by Udacity.  Aside from the code supplied from Udacity, the majority of the code was written while referencing online resources:
1. Starter code, including the HTML, CSS, and JS files were provided by Udacity from https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
2. I heavily relied on the webinar provided by Udacity thanks to @Roderick [FEND] found here https://zoom.us/recording/play/aulotDlzKFegQFIJTaTzKgWvNkVsYtlwO454vL1UPE1Cm6lOUBQCtfVurPOIAGAS?startTime=1529542978000
3. To get the "enemies" to go across the screen at a random speed, I referenced the documentation at MDN around "Math.Random" found here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

## Acknowledgements
As mentioned above, a huge thanks to @Roderick [FEND] for the webinar in which he laid out all the pieces necessary to get this game functional.  His github profile can be found here: https://github.com/bloom305

## TO-DO
Right now, this version of my repo is pretty simple.  This version is the minimum required to continue through the FEND course at Udacity.  I would like to come back to this repo & add more customization and personal flair.  I had an idea of naming the characters names of people I know in my personal life.  That way, they could select themselves when they play and the enemies generated would be customized to their hero.  I would also like to include a modal for a character selection screen.
